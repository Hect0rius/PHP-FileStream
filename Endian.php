|* - Free to use, you can make money out of this if you wish, you are not allowed to sell the io  *|
|*   only, you have to write a project containing the io to sell, thats the rule, all I require   *|
|*   is a shout out to me as Jed or Hect0r and this header remains in the io files without        *|
|*   removal.                                                                                     *|
|* - If I find any implementations without the license and no shout I will not be very happy and  *|
|*   I'll send you a very nasty letter, mmmmkay :)                                                *|
